SafeCitiesForm2014
==================

Sign the Safe Cities For Women pledge!

Visit http://www.actionaid.org/safecitiesforwomen to find out more about the campaign.

This repository contains the pledge widgets for people to embed into any site they like. By-the-numbers <iframe>ing will do the job just fine. All forms are 585px wide and of varying lengths.

Thanks for checking us out!
